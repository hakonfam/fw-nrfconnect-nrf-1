	  the private key.

	help
	  Absolute path to PEM key file containing the private key corresponding
	  to the public key included in MCUBoot. This will be used to sign the
	  image so that it can be verified by MCUBoot. Since MCUBoot is not
	  built from source, it is not possible for the build system to deduce
	  what key was used when compiling it. Hence, it is required that the
	  key is passed to the build system through this option.

config INIT_ARCH_HW_AT_BOOT

	help
	  The image will be booted directly by an unknown image which might not
	  leave the system in a clean state, so it is necessary to perform
	  architecture specific hardware initialization.

	  256kB - The maximum size of a net core image.
	  When performing a multi image update on the nRF53 the net core app
	  image is buffered in RAM. This option is used to define the size of
	  the reserved RAM area. Note that this area is only used when the
	  MCUboot image is running, so no its value will affect the RAM
	  available for the running application.
