HTTP Firmware Over the Air Download client
##########################################

The HTTP Firmware Over the Air Download client library provides functions to download a firmware file as an update candidate to MCUboots secondary slot.

Both :ref:`lib_download_client` and Zephyr`s MCUboot libraries are used to achieve this.
All events generated by these libraries are forwarded to the application.
